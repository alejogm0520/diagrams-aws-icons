[2021-09-17](https://d1.awsstatic.com/webteam/architecture-icons/q3-2021/Asset-Package_09172021.49796a977327744ded96470f1f94aafb1512f401.zip)

## What is it?

Shapes library with [AWS Architecture Icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/)
for [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net/)
([formerly draw.io](https://www.diagrams.net/blog/move-diagrams-net)) application.

The library can be loaded into diagrams.net by downloading particular `xml` files
and [loading them into application](https://www.diagrams.net/blog/custom-libraries)
or using links provided below.

## How it's different from the built-in AWS shapes library?

- more up-to-date
- shapes have connection points
- shapes size is 50x50 px instead of 78x78 px
  (I found it much more suitable personally)
- version with a single library with all the icons
